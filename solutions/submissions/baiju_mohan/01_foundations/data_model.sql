-- StackUp Engineering Academy — Data Engineering Assessment
-- Solution File: data_model.sql
-- Pillar: Foundations (Task 1.2) — star schema DDL, SCD2 dim_employee build,
--         and the staging load that Pillar 2's queries run against
-- Author: Baiju Mohan | Engine: DuckDB
-- =============================================================================
--
-- SCENARIO
-- --------
-- Presight runs a project management platform. This file designs and loads
-- the analytics warehouse that powers dashboards for Finance, Operations,
-- and Executive leadership. The business questions and query-optimisation
-- exercise that query this warehouse live in the sibling 02_sql_and_viz/
-- files: queries.sql (Task 2.1) and query_optimization.sql (Task 2.3).
--
-- PREREQUISITES
-- -------------
-- Run everything from the repo root (relative paths below assume it) and
-- have Pillar 1's Task 1.1/1.3 outputs on disk first — Section 1 reads
-- employees_clean.csv, Section 2 reads projects_clean.csv + transactions_
-- clean.csv. Full run order: see HOW_TO_RUN.md.
--
-- HOW TO USE
-- ----------
-- Section 1 has no path placeholders — run it directly in any SQL client
-- (DuckDB CLI, SQLTools against outputs/presight_warehouse.duckdb, etc.).
-- If the warehouse file already has these tables, delete
-- outputs/presight_warehouse.duckdb first for a clean rebuild (CREATE TABLE
-- fails on a table that already exists).
-- Section 2 (load) still uses an __OUTPUTS__ path placeholder, substituted
-- and run via:
--   solutions/submissions/baiju_mohan/02_sql_and_viz/run_queries.py
-- Then, against the loaded warehouse, see queries.sql and
-- query_optimization.sql in 02_sql_and_viz/.

-- ===========================================================================
-- SECTION 1 — TASK 1.2: Design the data model (Star Schema)
-- ===========================================================================
--
-- Classic Kimball star schema: one fact table (fact_transactions) at the
-- centre, surrounded by conformed dimensions. Every dimension uses a
-- surrogate INTEGER key (*_key) as its primary key and keeps the original
-- source-system identifier (project_id, employee_id, ...) as a natural key.
-- Surrogates over natural keys everywhere, for three reasons:
--   1. dim_employee is SCD2 — employee_id legitimately repeats across
--      multiple rows over time, so it can't be a PK on its own.
--   2. Integer surrogate keys join and index faster than string natural keys.
--   3. Natural keys can be reused/retired by source systems; surrogates never
--      change once assigned, so historical fact rows stay stable.


-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- dim_date
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Design decision: a full calendar dimension, not a raw DATE column on the
-- fact table, so every downstream query groups/filters by year, quarter,
-- weekday etc. via a cheap integer join instead of re-deriving those with
-- EXTRACT()/date-math in every query. date_key is YYYYMMDD as an INTEGER
-- (e.g. 20250115) rather than the DATE itself — it sorts naturally, joins
-- as a 4-byte int instead of an 8-byte date/string, and is what most BI
-- tools expect for a date dimension's surrogate key.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS dim_date (
    date_key      INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,   -- surrogate, formatted YYYYMMDD
    full_date     DATE NOT NULL UNIQUE,  -- natural key
    year          INTEGER NOT NULL,
    quarter       INTEGER NOT NULL,
    month         INTEGER NOT NULL,
    month_name    VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    week          INTEGER NOT NULL,
    day           INTEGER NOT NULL,
    day_of_week   INTEGER NOT NULL,      -- 1=Monday ... 7=Sunday
    day_name      VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    is_weekend    BOOLEAN NOT NULL
);


-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- dim_project
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Design decision: this is a Type 1 (overwrite) dimension — we only need
-- the current state of a project, not its history, so there's no valid_from/
-- valid_to here the way there is on dim_employee. The Task 1.1 derived
-- columns (budget_variance, is_over_budget, budget_utilisation_pct,
-- risk_level, status_category) are stored on the dimension rather than
-- recomputed in every query — they're deterministic functions of budget/
-- actual_cost/status/priority, so materialising them once here means Q1 and
-- the dashboard don't each need their own copy of that business logic.
-- project_manager_id is kept as a plain natural-key attribute, not an FK to
-- dim_employee: since dim_employee is versioned, "who manages this project"
-- is resolved at query time via dim_employee.is_current (see fact_transactions
-- below and Q2), not frozen to whichever employee version existed at load time.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS dim_project (
    project_key             INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    project_id               VARCHAR NOT NULL UNIQUE,   -- natural key
    project_name             VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    department               VARCHAR,
    status                   VARCHAR,
    status_category          VARCHAR,
    start_date                DATE,
    end_date                  DATE,
    budget                    DOUBLE,
    actual_cost               DOUBLE,
    budget_variance           DOUBLE,
    is_over_budget            BOOLEAN,
    duration_days             INTEGER,
    budget_utilisation_pct    DOUBLE,
    risk_level                VARCHAR,

    priority                  VARCHAR,
    region                    VARCHAR
);


-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- dim_employee — SCD Type 2
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Design decision: employees_salary_history.csv proves salary/role/level
-- change over time (up to 5 versions for the most-changed employees), and
-- Q6 plus fact_transactions' approver resolution both need point-in-time
-- correctness — "what was true about this person when this happened", not
-- just what's true today. A Type 1 dimension would silently destroy that
-- history on every reload. Population logic (staging tables, window
-- functions, validation) is below, after all six DDL statements.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS dim_employee (
    employee_key        INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,   -- surrogate, unique PER VERSION
    employee_id          VARCHAR NOT NULL,      -- natural key, repeats across versions
    full_name             VARCHAR,
    email                  VARCHAR,

    change_reason            VARCHAR
);


-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- dim_vendor
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Design decision: vendors only appear inside transactions.json (vendor_id +
-- vendor_name per line), so this dimension is derived by de-duplicating
-- those two fields rather than sourced from a standalone vendor master.
-- Type 1, not Type 2 — vendor names aren't expected to change in a way worth
-- tracking historically at this assessment's scope, and Q3 (concentration
-- risk) only needs current vendor identity, not a version history of it.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS dim_vendor (
    vendor_key    INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    vendor_id     VARCHAR NOT NULL UNIQUE,   -- natural key
    vendor_name   VARCHAR NOT NULL
);


-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- bridge_employee_project
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Design decision: an employee can work across multiple projects, and a
-- project can have multiple associated employees (a manager, and separately
-- whoever approves its transactions) — a many-to-many that a star schema
-- can't express as a plain FK on either dimension. project_role records
-- *why* the pair is linked (e.g. 'Manager', sourced from projects.csv) so
-- the same bridge table can later carry other relationship types (e.g.
-- 'Approver') without a schema change.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS bridge_employee_project (
    bridge_key      INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_key    INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES dim_employee(employee_key),
    project_key     INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES dim_project(project_key),
    project_role    VARCHAR   -- e.g. 'Manager', 'Team Member'
);


-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- fact_transactions
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Design decision: grain is one row per transaction (transaction_id) — the
-- most granular event available, so nothing downstream needs a coarser
-- pre-aggregation. employee_key resolves to the SCD2 version of the
-- approver that was CURRENT ON THE TRANSACTION DATE (see the point-in-time
-- join in Section 2), not whoever holds that employee_id today — this is
-- the entire reason dim_employee needed to be SCD2 rather than Type 1.
-- amount/currency/category/payment_status/invoice_ref/notes stay as
-- degenerate fact attributes rather than their own dimensions — none of
-- them have enough independent cardinality or attached metadata to justify
-- the extra join.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS fact_transactions (
    transaction_key   INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    transaction_id    VARCHAR NOT NULL UNIQUE,  -- natural key
    project_key       INTEGER REFERENCES dim_project(project_key),
    employee_key      INTEGER REFERENCES dim_employee(employee_key),  -- the approver
    vendor_key        INTEGER REFERENCES dim_vendor(vendor_key),
    date_key          INTEGER REFERENCES dim_date(date_key),
    amount            DOUBLE,
    currency          VARCHAR,
    category          VARCHAR,
    payment_status    VARCHAR,
    invoice_ref       VARCHAR,
    notes             VARCHAR
);


-- ===========================================================================
-- Reset — makes this whole file safely re-runnable
-- ===========================================================================
-- CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS above means re-running this file against a
-- warehouse that already has the schema no longer errors — but every table
-- would still be reloaded from empty, so anything already inside them needs
-- clearing first (a second run would otherwise violate the PRIMARY KEY /
-- UNIQUE constraints below, or double every row). Cleared in reverse FK
-- order — fact_transactions and bridge_employee_project reference the four
-- dim_* tables, so they're emptied first; deleting a dim_* row a child
-- table still points to would fail the FOREIGN KEY constraint otherwise.
DELETE FROM fact_transactions;
DELETE FROM bridge_employee_project;

DELETE FROM dim_project;

-- ===========================================================================
-- Populate dim_employee (SCD Type 2)
-- ===========================================================================
-- Source: outputs/employees_clean.csv (Task 1.3 output — NOT the raw
-- datasets/employees.csv) + datasets/employees_salary_history.csv.
--
-- DESIGN DECISIONS:
--
-- 1. Only role/level/salary are tracked as true Type 2 attributes.
--    full_name/email/department/region/status/years_experience/manager_id/
--    hire_date are carried forward from the current employees_clean.csv
--    snapshot on every version, because the history file has no historical
--    values for those columns — there's nothing to version them against.
--    This is a documented scope limit, not an oversight.
--
-- 2. 594 of 1,000 employees have salary history (1-4 changes each, so 2-5
--    total versions once the current row is added — matches the task's
--    "expect 2-5 versions" note). Each history row except an employee's
--    most recent becomes a closed (is_current = FALSE) version, chained via
--    LEAD(effective_date) so valid_to = the next version's valid_from - 1
--    day, with no gaps and no overlaps by construction. The CURRENT version
--    for these employees takes role/level/salary from employees_clean.csv,
--    not from the last history row — checked directly, and 593 of 594
--    agree exactly, but EMP0084 doesn't (history's last row: salary 16314 /
--    Junior; employees_clean.csv: salary 23354 / Mid). employees_clean.csv
--    is documented as the "current state" export, so it wins as the source
--    of truth for the is_current = TRUE row.
--
-- 3. The remaining 406 employees have no history: one row each, valid_from
--    = hire_date, valid_to = 9999-12-31, is_current = TRUE.
--
-- 4. Sentinel valid_from = 1900-01-01: 8 employees have BOTH no salary
--    history AND a hire_date that Task 1.3 nulled out as unrecoverable
--    ("-999" / "99999-01-01" in the raw source). With no usable valid_from
--    from either source, these get an explicit "unknown start" sentinel
--    instead of a NULL, which would violate the NOT NULL constraint above
--    and break Q3/Q5's interval-arithmetic checks below.
--
-- 5. The final INSERT joins tmp_* back to stg_employees ONCE, on
--    employee_id, for the carried-forward descriptive columns — not a
--    correlated subquery per column. A subquery-per-column re-runs the
--    lookup independently for every output column; a single JOIN resolves
--    all of them together in one pass, which is both faster and shorter to
--    read.

-- must resolve to whichever dim_employee version was valid in 2022, not to
-- today's row. This is the single design choice that makes dim_employee's
-- SCD2 shape actually pay off, rather than being modelling for its own sake.
--
-- Data quality note surfaced by this join: 25 transactions have a non-null
-- approved_by whose hire_date is AFTER the transaction_date — someone
-- "approved" a transaction before they were employed, per the source data.
-- The BETWEEN join correctly leaves employee_key NULL for these rather than
-- silently matching them to a later SCD2 version, which would misrepresent
-- who was actually at the company on that date.

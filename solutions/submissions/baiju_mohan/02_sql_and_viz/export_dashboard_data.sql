-- Pillar: SQL & Data Visualization (Task 2.4) — Power BI data source extracts
-- Author: Baiju Mohan | Engine: DuckDB
-- =============================================================================
--
-- PREREQUISITES
-- -------------
-- Run against the fully loaded warehouse (data_model.sql Sections 1+2 must
-- already be populated) — same prerequisite as queries.sql.
--
-- HOW TO USE
-- ----------
-- Run standalone in any SQL client (DuckDB CLI, SQLTools, etc.) against
-- outputs/presight_warehouse.duckdb. The target folder
-- (outputs/results/baiju_mohan/02_sql_and_viz/dashboard_data/) must already
-- exist — COPY TO writes files, it doesn't create directories.
--
-- WHY THESE AREN'T JUST Q1/Q3 FROM queries.sql, VERBATIM
-- --------------------------------------------------------
-- Task 2.4 names "Q1 results" / "Q3 results" as the data source for two
-- visuals, but both those queries are answers to Task 2.1's specific
-- business questions, not dashboard-ready extracts:
--   - Q1 filters to departments over 90% budget utilisation — on this data
--     that's a single row (Legal). A bar chart titled "actual spend vs
--     budget by department" needs every department to be a meaningful
--     comparison, so this file re-aggregates the same budget/actual_cost
--     logic Q1 uses, without the >90% filter.
--   - Q3 flags vendors whose spend share exceeds a 5%/10% risk threshold —
--     it isn't a top-5 ranking. The donut chart spec explicitly asks for
--     "top 5 + Other", which needs the vendors ranked by spend directly.

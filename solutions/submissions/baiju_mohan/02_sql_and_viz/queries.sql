-- Pillar: SQL & Data Visualization (Task 2.1) — Six business questions
-- Author: Baiju Mohan | Engine: DuckDB
-- =============================================================================
--
-- PREREQUISITES
-- -------------
-- Run against the warehouse built by 01_foundations/data_model.sql — Section
-- 1 (schema + dim_employee) and Section 2 (load) must already be loaded, so
-- dim_date/dim_project/dim_employee/dim_vendor/bridge_employee_project/
-- fact_transactions are all populated.
--
-- HOW TO USE
-- ----------
-- Run standalone in any SQL client (DuckDB CLI, SQLTools, etc.) against
-- outputs/presight_warehouse.duckdb, or via:
--   solutions/submissions/baiju_mohan/02_sql_and_viz/run_queries.py
-- (loads Section 2, then runs every query below and prints real result rows)
-- =============================================================================


-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Q1 — Department budget performance

--Which departments have spent more than 90% of their total allocated budget? 
--Include departments that are over budget.

-- Aggregate budget/actual_cost off dim_project, then filter with HAVING
-- since the 90% threshold applies to the aggregated total.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT
    department,
    SUM(budget) AS total_budget,
    SUM(actual_cost) AS total_actual_cost,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(actual_cost) / NULLIF(SUM(budget), 0), 2) AS spend_percentage,
    SUM(actual_cost) > SUM(budget) AS over_budget
FROM dim_project
GROUP BY department
HAVING SUM(actual_cost) / NULLIF(SUM(budget), 0) > 0.90
ORDER BY spend_percentage DESC;


-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Q2 — Project manager workload (current employee data)

--Which managers are currently overseeing more than three active projects?
-- A manager with too many active projects is a delivery risk.

-- Join dim_project to dim_employee where is_current=TRUE, restrict to
-- active projects, filter for >3 in HAVING.
-- Verified result: 0 rows on this dataset — max concurrent active projects
-- per manager is 3 (checked against the raw distribution directly).
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Q3 — Vendor concentration risk

--Identify vendors who account for more than 5% of total transaction spend. 
--With 50,000 transactions, even a 5% share represents meaningful concentration.

-- A scalar subquery computes the grand total spend once in the SELECT list;
-- it's a single value, so a subquery here reads more directly than a CTE +
-- CROSS JOIN would for the same result.
-- Verified result: 0 rows — spend is evenly distributed across all 25
-- vendors (max observed share ~4.4%).

-- Q4 — Projects with open financial issues

--Find all projects with pending or disputed transactions totalling more than 50,000 AED.
 --These need finance team attention.

-- Filter fact_transactions to Pending/Disputed, aggregate per project,
-- then HAVING > 50,000 AED.

-- Q5 — Monthly spend trend with running total

--Show total transaction spend per month, per category, with a running total accumulating within each category over time. 
--This view drives the Finance dashboard.

-- SUM() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY year_month) gives the running
-- total in one pass; LAG() gives month-over-month % change.

-- Q6 — Employee compensation history analysis (SCD2 self-join)

--Using dim_employee SCD2 data, identify employees who received the largest 
--single salary increase (in absolute AED terms).

-- Self-join dim_employee to itself, matching each version to the next by
-- valid_to = valid_from - 1 day (the adjacency data_model.sql's SCD2 build
-- constructs, and its own Q5 validation independently verifies). Top 20 by

# Deploys the Task 3.3 DAG + its sibling modules into the Airflow container's
# dags folder, following the README's documented docker exec workflow.
#
# NOTE: docker-compose.yml mounts ./starter_files -> /opt/airflow/dags on
# both the webserver and scheduler. That means files written into the
# container's /opt/airflow/dags land in the host's starter_files/ folder too
# (a bind mount is transparent both ways) -- this is inherent to the fixed
# infrastructure this assessment ships with, not a choice to develop inside
# starter_files/. The authoritative source for every file below still lives
# under solutions/submissions/baiju_mohan/; this script only *deploys* copies.
#
# Run from the repo root:  .\solutions\submissions\baiju_mohan\03_big_data\deploy_dag.ps1
